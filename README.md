# GunRush

GunRush is a 3D game developed entirely by me as my course final project. Over a few months, I learned C# and how to use the Godot game engine to create this project from scratch. This repository showcases the culmination of my dedication, self-learning, and passion for game development.

## Features

- **Fast-paced gameplay**: The player has to beat his and others record while defeating bots and moving optimally.
- **Custom Game Mechanics**: Designed and implemented core mechanics like player movement, shooting, and enemy interactions using Godot and C#.
- **Level Design**: Levels are generated with a seed and prebuilt "rooms" as a dungeon, meaning you can play the same level over and over or play an very big number of different levels.

## Learning Journey

GunRush was my first game development project, and it involved:

1. **Learning C#**: From no C# experience to implementing complex game logic.
2. **Mastering Godot**: Familiarized myself with the Godot game engineâ€™s interface, scripting language (GDScript and C#), and tools for creating 2D games.
3. **Game Development Fundamentals**: Built a foundation in game physics, resource management, and UI design.

## Challenges Overcome

- **Learning Curve**: Had to quickly adapt to a new programming language and development environment.
- **Debugging and Optimization**: Solved issues related to game physics and performance to ensure smooth gameplay.

## Future Improvements

- Add more levels and gameplay mechanics.
- Enhance visuals with particle effects and advanced animations.
- Refine game balancing for a more polished experience.
